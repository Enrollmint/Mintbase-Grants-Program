**Level:** 3


## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 


### Overview

**A tag line:**

Onboard Communities with EnrollMint Membership NFTs.


**Project description:**

EnrollMint is a DAO of DAOs partnership between established members of the NEAR economy: the Harmonic Technology Guild, Arroz Estúdios, Charm3d, and DAO Records. With Harmonic Guild as the development partner and Arroz Estúdios as the testcase user, EnrollMint has built an MVP which has created ~1,500 new wallets seeded with Arroz Membership NFTs. EnrollMint's vision, though, goes beyond this test of concept. 

The EnrollMint partners see the product as a tool to bring in-person communities into the era of web3. With EnrollMint, these in-person communities (such as any member clubs, fraternal organizations, art communities, independent music venues and many more) can leverage the democratic and transparent nature of web3 to support their operations. Long term vision for this project includes features such as membership based DAO voting, membership dues processing, expanded administrator intelligence, and an array of other features. 

Practically though, this project is still in its early phases, before it can be expanded in scope it first had to be refined.During our initial outreach and beta tests we came across two common questions from business/organization representatives.
How Do I Use It
How Do I Make Money
EnrollMint plans on using the funds provided by Mintbase to make the membership platform intuitive for business owners and administration to manage their membership base, easy for members to use, and scalable to accommodate organizations of any size.
**Goal:**

Our goal is to onboard pre-existing communities into web3 through membership NFTs powered by NEAR. We will use their engagement with their club to drive adoption and understanding of crypto utilities. Through these techniques EnrollMint will build a self-sustaining business which will sell membership NFTs and associated technology to clubs.

EnrollMint will give communities and users their first taste of the powers of web3. While many of these functions are outside of the scope of our initial launch, we believe that they are an important part of convincing groups and users of the purpose of web3 – things like membership based DAO voting, automated financial processing, decentralized administration capabilities, multi-signature treasury management, proof of attendance, and eventually cross-club event support. Using NFTs is a way to achieve this, rather than NFTs for the sake of NFTs…
 
Onboarding users, i.e. setting them up with a sufficiently secure wallet, an NFT, enough funds to make a couple transactions, and pushing them to do their first actions, is the essential first step.
Right now we are focused on the "door" interaction with users. There are two cases: if the user already has the membership NFT and if they do not. 

If the user has a membership NFT: 
1) They use a QR code to pull up the club's subdomain.
2) The user connects their wallet to the club's subdomain.
3) The display function in the subdomain shows the users membership NFT.
4) The bouncer lets the member into the event.
All of this is the same from our previous iteration. However, we are improving our systems in the other case.

If the user does not have a membership NFT:
1) They use a QR code to pull up the club's subdomain.
2) The user requests a membership NFT as well as filling out any required information for the club, ex. name, member type, and also NearName.
3) The user provides payment to the bouncer (cash or credit outside of our application).
4) The bouncer employs EnrollMint's admin portal to approve the prospect's membership. This is either a one by one or a bulk process.
5) The user receives their club membership NFT and enough Near fungible for a couple transactions.
6) Party.


**An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem:**

This project employs Mintbase NFTs. It uses Mintbase's SDK. Once users are onboarded through EnrollMint they can be interwoven to the NEAR project ecosystem. EnrollMint is a reproducible first step in the long process of converting crypto newbies to crypto natives.
But more generally, EnrollMint has an opportunity to offer huge value and insights by building in public and collaborating with Mintbase to flex the toolkit  for developers and would-be users.  
Developers documenting the process of our build will provide learnings, lessons and inquiries to the greater developer and builder communities. Growing project awareness and potential dev network The opportunity of building in public also yields itself to more dynamic proof of concepts and case studies. 
To this point, most of web3 and crypto offerings have remained niche. 
But, our prospective client base, and current partners, serve a more general audience of non-crypto natives. Many may be interacting on-chain for the first time, whether they know it or not.
We are able to outline our value proposition through documenting our growth and applications with different organizations as they apply our suite of tools in a real life setting. Provide context and clarity to our project and why members of an organization should be excited to move on-chain. 
Offering tutorials, inside views and even opening for suggestions from those most likely to use our platform. 
Building an on-chain platform for in-person memberships is one of the most organic and effective ways to onboard users, build user trust and confidence.  


**An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project:**

A genuine web3 future requires products and systems like this. We need to merge the digital and the real world. We need to begin the long journey of democratizing and decentralizing the software that underpins our social lives.
  
Also one of our partners, Arroz Estudios, has a genuine need for this product and is receiving requests from similar organizations for it. In that way, we already have a significantly sized client ready for integration and potential media coverage.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**

EnrollMint is the front line in user and community onboarding. We aim for a global reach, to onboard communities and attendees one at a time. Our goal is to acquire users in mass and to get them continually and positively interacting with a web3 enabled product.

After users and communities come to understand the benefits of web3, we believe they will begin to employ the other applications in the ecosystem, as well as onboard financially. We believe that communities who onboard to EnrollMint will later set up NFT stores, view and create NFT content, employ DeFi, play-to-earn, and all of the other wonderful use cases for NFTs and fungible crypto.


**Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's user base, yourself)?**

EnrollMint sells its value to communities and clubs. Our goal is to onboard clubs in high status and the avant-garde.

Crypto has its roots in the counterculture. For these reasons we target art houses, social clubs, independent music venues, and literary societies. 

We also believe that EnrollMint will find success in luxury clubs such as cigar bars, wine clubs, museums, and conservancies. 


**What need(s) does your project meet?**

EnrollMint is meant to be a club membership software as a service. We apply the democratizing and transparency powers of web3 to the membership club use-case.


** Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem? **

POAPs could be considered similar, as covered in the next section.
**If so, how is your project different?**

EnrollMint is different from POAPs and ticketing in that it services recurring event membership clubs. Ticketing and POAP are just one time interactions. We see EnrollMint as a tool for people to get access to the private spaces of public accommodation. 

One of the unique selling propositions of EnrollMint is its ease of use. EnrollMint is a tool which makes the hyper ‘easy to use’ blockchain - NEAR, even more intuitive. It lets the non-crypto natives use the functionality of NFTs without knowing they’re engaging with crypto or blockchain technology. In this way it’s a very powerful mass onboarding solution.


 **If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?**

So far not that we have seen.

## Development Status:

EnrollMint has a live MVP. We have distributed ~1,500 Arroz Estudios EnrollMint membership NFTs until the end of November. The basic pages and functionalities of our product are working, but a recent bug emerged related to the new indexer used by Mintbase. 

The reason we require funds is to improve and expand our product, and more specifically focus on these 5 aspects:
1. sustainability of the core functionality
2. scalability ladder
3. basic administrator features
4. basic visitor features
5. on-chain verification

Our goal with this funding is to sharpen our onboarding capabilities sufficient to handle our first grasps at scale up. With a community successfully onboarded to the platform and most bugs squashed, we can begin the process of ideating and iterating to better serve our prospect clients with functions, features, and improved user experience.
1. & 2. Our goal with UI/UX improvements is to offer the most frictionless and familiar user experience possible. Improving the usability and functionality of the platform for organizations, admin and members. 
People are accustomed to simple, reliable interfaces, and instantaneous response times from their phones. People won’t wait patiently for something to load or for an extra click. They care about instant gratification, and we need to accommodate that by improving our UI/UX.
To have a truly viable product to sell to the public, organizations need to be able to operate, onboard, manage and scale themselves.
3. By creating a dashboard for organizations to manage their memberships, rewards and other data inputs, we are offering a fundamental value to the business, making it easier to use, and more likely to adopt the product. 
Our target audience is business owners (organizations) that have or aspire to have a membership program. 
For business owners to get the most out of our membership NFT platform, we need to create an administration hub that allows organizations to simply and cleanly catalog the most relevant on-chain activity from members inside the organization, and also customize basic controls that will help improve the experience for the owners and its members. Including developing loyalty programs, designating rewards, incentives and other milestones–all managed from a single dashboard. 
The dashboard also carries value across other platforms. Using similar dashboards and databases to improve user/admin experiences for other organizations and projects that need to manage a community. 
4. Current onramps into crypto are one of the biggest deterrents for onboarding the general public. By improving the payment processing system in simplicity and accessibility, we are able to eliminate one of the largest barriers of entry for prospective users.
This is the rationale behind transitioning from Magic.Link to KeyPom. We believe KeyPom will provide our users a faster, more seamless experience, while simultaneously making our project more autonomous and decentralized.

5. Nothing is more valuable to business owners than data they can use to serve their customer (membership) base. The better we can present manageable ways to organize relevant datasets for the organization and its members, the better we can provide a lasting and valuable service to clients.
Storing data on member’s interactions on-chain would greatly benefit these organizations and open up a wide range of opportunities for engaging with the club's audience.
